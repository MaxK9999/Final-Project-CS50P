# Description

Boom Snake is a 2D game using Pygame in Python. It's a simple game based off of the original Snake game but implemented with a Doom theme over it 
(since I'm quite a Doom fan myself). The game is controlled with either WASD or UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys and the character gets to kill(collect) enemy sprites. 
For every sprite collected the game logs +1 to the score which is displayed in the middle of the screen and in the end your score and highscore of the session are displayed. 
Once a player dies by hitting the edge of the screen he/she can either restart or quit the game with the R an Q keys respectively.

# About Me

My name is Maxim Koltypin, born and raised in The Netherlands in 1999 and currently working as a Marine 1st Class in the Royal Dutch Marine Corps. 
After finishing CS50X I decided to continue with my CS50 journey by taking Python next and I thouroughly enjoyed the course aswell as working on this project. 
Being my first ever experience with game development I decided to start with something small and something I could grasp easily. 
I plan on taking CS50Web next as I've noticed that I did prefer working on my first project (WRKOUT, fullstack website for CS50X final project) over this project.
